# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on "Keep a Changelog" and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.32.4] - 2026-02-06
### Fixed
- Improved input validation and recipe selection to ensure only intended gases/fluids trigger the correct recipe and to prevent unintended recipe overrides when multiple inputs are present.


## [0.1.32.3] - 2026-01-31
### Fixed
- Output: Items with NBT data were not correctly recognized for insertion into empty output ports and therefore could not be inserted.
- JEI is now sorted by recipe ID.

## [0.1.32.2] - 2026-01-20
### Added
- New server command `/mm reform` (admin/OP only):
  - Asynchronously scans loaded chunks in players' view distances and triggers revalidation of discovered controllers.
  - Sends periodic progress updates to the command issuer and a final summary when finished.
  - Port blocks (Item/Fluid/Energy) now notify nearby controllers on removal (`onRemove`) so controllers can react immediately.

### Changed
- Controller/block-entity implementation:
  - Removed reflection-based manipulation of controller internals; replaced with explicit, public setter APIs.
  - Structure validations are executed safely on the server thread; asynchronous/delayed execution reduces races.

### Fixed
- Bug: Multiblock remained in a "dead" (not formed) state after removal and re-placement of parts.
  - Fixed race conditions by invoking immediate and delayed revalidation when parts are placed, and by notifying controllers when parts are removed.
- Sync fix: Block entity changes are now followed by `sendBlockUpdated(...)` to ensure clients see updated formed/unformed state and GUIs stay consistent.

## [0.1.31]
### Added
- New Priority Setter item:
  - Right-click increments priority (0..10). When priority reaches 10, and you right-click it again it wraps to 0.
  - Shift + Right-click in air resets the Priority Setter item to 0.
  - Shift + Right-click on an output port applies the currently selected priority to that port (no GUI needed).
  - Tooltip on the item shows the currently selected priority.
  - Jade/Waila integration: shows the currently selected priority for output ports only.
- Priority behavior for outputs:
  - Outputs now support a priority value (int, default 0). Max priority is 10.
  - Outputs will be filled by priority groups (highest priority first). When a priority group is full, filling continues to the next, lower priority group ("full-to-one" behavior).

### Changed
- Controller and storage behavior:
  - The controller uses references to port storage objects and reads priorities from those storage instances on demand. Changing a port's priority via the Priority Setter item is effective immediately.
- Tooltip and client data:
  - The server-side provider writes priority data only for output ports; input ports no longer expose priority in Jade/Waila.

### Security / Permissions
- Priority setting permissions:
  - Only players who have modify permissions on a port may change its priority. Integration respects claim managers (e.g., FTBChunks): only the claimer and their team can change priorities for ports in a claimed chunk.
  - Applying a priority requires the player to be able to modify the clicked block (server-side check).
