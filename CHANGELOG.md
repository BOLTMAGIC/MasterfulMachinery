# Changelog 0.1.31

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on "Keep a Changelog" and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New Priority Setter item:
  - Right-click increments priority (0..10). When priority reaches 10, and you right-click it again it wraps to 0.
  - Shift + Right-click in air resets the Priority Setter item to 0.
  - Shift + Right-click on an output port applies the currently selected priority to that port (no GUI needed).
  - Tooltip on the item shows the currently selected priority.
  - Jade/Waila integration: shows the currently selected priority for output ports only.
- Priority behavior for outputs:
  - Outputs now support a priority value (int, default 0). Max priority is 10.
  - Outputs will be filled by priority groups (highest priority first). When a priority group is full, filling continues to the next, lower priority group ("full-to-one" behavior).

### Changed
- Controller and storage behavior:
  - The controller uses references to port storage objects and reads priorities from those storage instances on demand. Changing a port's priority via the Priority Setter item is effective immediately.
- Tooltip and client data:
  - The server-side provider writes priority data only for output ports; input ports no longer expose priority in Jade/Waila.

### Security / Permissions
- Priority setting permissions:
  - Only players who have modify permissions on a port may change its priority. Integration respects claim managers (e.g., FTBChunks): only the claimer and their team can change priorities for ports in a claimed chunk.
  - Applying a priority requires the player to be able to modify the clicked block (server-side check).
